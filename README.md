# ML-Dynamics
Toolbox to analyze and characterize protein dynamics

> [!NOTE]  
> Note for Chris: Functions will go under the **ML-Dynamics** directory. These functions should be called in **scripts** to create the "ML Pipeline". 

> [!NOTE]  
> Note for Matthias: This is the codebase for the Kemp Eliminase ML project.
